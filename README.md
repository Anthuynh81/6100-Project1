## Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge

Our Business Problem relates to the sale of electric cars. In order to increase sales, we want to look at electric car data in order to see what features of electric cars have the biggest impact on sales. We want to look at many different aspects of the car from range, battery capacity, speed, acceleration, etc to see what can be done to increase sales.

## Dataset

## Research Objectives and Question
1. Which car model is the most affordable to buy while still having the best overall fuel efficiency? 

2. What type of relationship does the price have with the miles per gallon? 

3. Given that different cities have varying average fuel efficiencies, which city has the highest and lowest average fuel efficiencies? And which automaker is popular in those cities? Exist any relationships at all? 

4. Is there often a relationship of any type between the top speed, the acceleration, and the cost of the vehicle?
This is the questions i come up with for our group proj

## Exploratory Data Analysis
After exploring th

## Dashboard
For our dashboard for the project, we decided used AWS sagemaker, Attached in the deliverable 2 folder in this github, we have the different graphs that were generated.

## Data Preparation
To prepare our data for the next part of the project, we used Sage Maker to transform the initial dataset to be more fitting for machine learning applications.
